  <h1>Harding's Political Quiz</h1>
  <p>This political quiz was designed by E. Harding as a replacement for most existing ones, due to the utterly unnecessary multicollinearity
  in their dimensions' axes. Some question wording may be biased due to my obvious contempt for the position. Relax and answer to the best
  of your beliefs and ability.</p>

  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="0" name="question9">I supported it<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="1" name="question9">I opposed it; it was an act of American aggression against a country fighting terrorists within its borders<br>

  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="0" name="question13">Sure; he was a bad and unpopular dude<br>

  <input type="radio" class="answ" value=".5" name="question14">"Citizen protest and agitation for better treatment is always good. I hope it stays that way, and outside powers don't try to exploit things for their own ends. I don't think western commentators can have much effect on Iran except for keeping their own govts out of it."<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="1" name="question14">I'm against them; any risk of destabilizing the Iranian government risks turning Iran into an pawn of the West at one of the worst possible times for it<br>

  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="0" name="question15">Sure; he was a murderous dictator<br>

  <p>Were the maritime empires of old (e.g., British, French, Belgian, German, Dutch, Japanese) good for the world?</p>

  <input type="radio" class="answ" value=".2" name="question23">No, but they would have been had their achievements matched up with their rhetoric<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="1" name="question23">No; the countries these empires conquered should have charted their own course<br>
  <p>It is dangerous to attempt to impose so-called superior ways of life on other countries</p>
  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="1" name="question24">Agree<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ" value="0" name="question24">Disagree; there is greater danger in countries not adopting superior ways of life than there is in having them imposed.<br>

  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio1">A ruthless budget-cutter<br>
  <p>Should all theft from private property owners during natural disasters be punished (given zero policing costs, etc.)?</p>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio2">Of course<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio2">No; that's cruel<br>
  <p>What are your thoughts on Martin Luther King?</p>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio3">Nice guy, Freedom Fighter (even if a mild one)<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio3">Horrible person; typical pro-affirmative-action Democratic Blacktivist with idiotic inclinations toward socialism<br>
  <p>Do you agree with the Chinese economic reforms of the 1980s?</p>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio5">Of course; they helped reduce Chinese poverty<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio5">No; China should have continued on a truly socialist model of development rather than reintroducing capitalist exploitation, in order to serve as a vanguard of international Communism and an example to all socialist nations<br>
  <p>What are your thoughts on marriage?</p>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio6">Traditional marriage is a public good and it is fully right to criticize deviations from it<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio6">"People who try to sit in judgment of other people's marriages without being asked to do so, and without having intimate knowledge of what takes place in the marriage, are sanctimonious busybodies, at best." (responding to questions about his thoughts on the President's marital infidelity)<br>

  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio7">Of course; taxing investment income is double taxation<br>

  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value=".3" name="questio7">Of course not; investment income is capitalist exploitation of the labor of others (but I fear raising taxes on investment income to 100% due to potential economic effects)<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio7">Of course not; investment income is capitalist exploitation of the labor of others, and such exploitation should be fully eliminated by force<br>

  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio8">Disagree<br>
  <p>"Nobody is worth hundreds of millions. Nobody. The life of the CEO making all that money is worth no more and no less than the life of the drunk homeless guy who offended Justin Keller by leaning on his car. The person who had the capital and the support to be able to go to college, make profitable connections, and get the investments to begin a startup is not working harder than the person who is doing two minimum wage jobs and getting periodically laid off by a volatile economy, and I am disgusted by these people who have failed to learn these basic lessons in life.
  But greed and short-sighted selfishness and a lack of empathy seem to make up the recipe for financial success, which allows these oblivious parasites to foster more greed and short-sighted selfishness and lack of empathy."</p>

  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio10">No; the doctrine of "white babies, black babies, neon-pink babies, smart babies, Downs babies, conjoined twin babies, rich babies, poor babies, all the babies!" is raw insanity<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio10">Of course; eugenics is bad<br>
  <p>Government-run schools for the general public should be disbanded, replaced, if with anything, by an increase to the child tax credit</p>

  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio16">Yes<br>
  <p>So-called "price-gouging" and "speculation" during natural disasters should be prohibited</p>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio17">Agree<br>
  <input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio17">Disagree<br>
