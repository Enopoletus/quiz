  <h1>Harding's Political Quiz</h1>
  <p>This political quiz was designed by E. Harding as a replacement for most existing ones, due to the utterly unnecessary multicollinearity
  in their dimensions' axes. Some question wording may be biased due to my obvious contempt for the position. Relax and answer to the best
  of your beliefs and ability. Internet Explorer does not support the modern JavaScript in this quiz.
  This quiz is purely client-side, so no one but you can see your results. If you want to record your results into the scatter plot at the bottom,
  contact me on Twitter @Enopoletus.</p>

  <h2>Left/right questions</h2>
  <p>Paul Ryan is best described as </p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio1">An enabler of fiscal profligacy unprecedented in scope and size given economic conditions</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio1">A ruthless budget-cutter</label><br>
  <p>Should all theft from private property owners during natural disasters be punished (given zero policing costs, etc.)?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio2">Of course</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio2">No</label><br>
  <p>Which comes closest to your views on Martin Luther King?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio3">Nice guy, Freedom Fighter (even if a mild one)</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio3">Horrible person; typical pro-affirmative-action Democratic Blacktivist with idiotic inclinations toward socialism</label><br>
  <p>Do you agree with the Chinese economic reforms of the 1980s?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio5">Of course; they helped reduce Chinese poverty</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio5">No; China should have continued on a truly socialist model of development rather than reintroducing capitalist exploitation</label><br>
  <p>What stance <i>most closely</i> aligns with your thoughts on marriage?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio6">Marriage is a public good and it is fully right to criticize deviations from it</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio6">"People who try to sit in judgment of other people's marriages without being asked to do so, and without having intimate knowledge of what takes place in the marriage, are sanctimonious busybodies, at best." (responding to questions about his thoughts on the President's marital infidelity)</label><br>
  <p>Do you support eliminating all taxes on investment income?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio7">Of course; taxing investment income is double taxation</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value=".5" name="questio7">Of course not; taxes on investment income provide a useful source of revenue to the government</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value=".3" name="questio7">Of course not; investment income is capitalist exploitation of the labor of others (but I fear raising taxes on investment income to 100% due to potential economic effects)</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio7">Of course not; investment income is capitalist exploitation of the labor of others, and such exploitation should be fully eliminated by force</label><br>
  <p>"[Insert tortured liberal qualifiers] but ultimately Castro was good"</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio8">Agree</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio8">Disagree</label><br>
  <p>"Nobody is worth hundreds of millions. Nobody. The life of the CEO making all that money is worth no more and no less than the life of the drunk homeless guy who offended Justin Keller by leaning on his car. The person who had the capital and the support to be able to go to college, make profitable connections, and get the investments to begin a startup is not working harder than the person who is doing two minimum wage jobs and getting periodically laid off by a volatile economy, and I am disgusted by these people who have failed to learn these basic lessons in life.
  But greed and short-sighted selfishness and a lack of empathy seem to make up the recipe for financial success, which allows these oblivious parasites to foster more greed and short-sighted selfishness and lack of empathy."</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio9">Agree; nobody should be more rich than [some number]</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio9">Disagree</label><br>
  <p>Do you support agnosticism about the genetic characteristics of those you want to be born?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio10">No; the doctrine of "white babies, black babies, neon-pink babies, smart babies, Downs babies, conjoined twin babies, rich babies, poor babies, all the babies!" is raw insanity</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio10">Of course; eugenics is bad</label><br>
  <p>Government-run schools for the general public should be disbanded, replaced, if with anything, by an increase to the child tax credit</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio11">Agree, government schools are tremendously wasteful and inefficient and parents can come up with vastly more cost-effective ways to teach their children</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio11">Disagree; education is valuable, and government-run schools can provide it</label><br>
  <p>The U.S. should adopt single-payer healthcare, as Taiwan and Canada have long done</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio12">Agree</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio12">Disagree</label><br>

  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio13">Of course</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio13">Of course not</label><br>
  <p>Should over 95% of illegal immigrants who arrived in the US before the age of 18, and guilty of no other crime, be subject to deportation <i>if caught</i>?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio14">Of course</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio14">Of course not</label><br>
  <p>Foreign aid from the richer to the poorer nations should be dramatically increased</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio15">Agree</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio15">Disagree</label><br>
  <p>Do you approve of interracial marriage?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio16">No</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio16">Yes</label><br>
  <p>So-called "price-gouging" and "speculation" during natural disasters should be prohibited</p>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="0" name="questio17">Agree</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio17">Disagree</label><br>

  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio20">Disagree</label><br>

  <label><input type="radio" class="answ2" value="1" name="questio21">Disagree</label><br>
